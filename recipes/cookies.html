    <p>Cookies are a great desert for any dinner or party.</p>
    <p>This website is only something im making for the odin project, however, so it might not be the best source for a good recipe. Better sources may be found with a quick google search or maybe even in a local book in your town's library. I got this recipe from allrecipes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>4 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
     <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
     <li>2 cups butter, softened</li>
     <li>1 ½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
     <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
     <li>2 (3.4 ounce) packages instant vanilla</li>
     <li>4 eggs</li>
     <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
     <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
     <li>2 cups chopped walnuts (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
     <li>Sift together flour and baking soda in a medium bowl, set aside.</li>
     <li>Cream together butter, brown sugar, and white sugar in a large bowl. Beat in instant pudding mix until blended. Stir in eggs and vanilla.</li>
     <li>Add flour mixture to the butter mixture until it's well incorporated. Fold in chocolate chips and nuts.</li>
     <li>Drop cookies by rounded spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.</li>
     <li>Bake in batches in the preheated oven until the edges are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes, switching racks halfway through.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Again, all credit for the recipe and instructions goes to Allrecipes since this is not my recipe.</p>
