    <p>Salad is a good fresh side dish or a meal on its own. This is a recipe for a green salad.</p>
    <p>This website is only something im making for the odin project, however, so it might not be the best source for a good recipe. Better sources may be found with a quick google search or maybe even in a local book in your town's library. I got this recipe from allrecipes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
