    <p>I love pizza, it is my favorite food and this is what my favorite pizzas ideally look like.</p>
    <p>This website is only something im making for the odin project, however, so it might not be the best source for a good recipe. Better sources may be found with a quick google search or maybe even in a local book in your town's library. I got this recipe from allrecipes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
     <li>Quarter teaspoon white sugar</li>
     <li>3 quarter cup lukewarm water</li>
     <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
     <li>Half a teaspoon of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
     <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water that's 110 degrees F (44 degrees C) in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 8 minutes. </li>
     <li>Combine 1 3/4 cups flour and salt in a large bowl. Pour yeast mixture; mix well until dough comes together.</li>
     <li>Roll dough into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to a greased pizza pan.</li>
     <li>Add your favorite toppings, and bake. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>To Bake:</h4>
    <p>Top crust as desired and bake at 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) until golden, 8 to 10 minutes.</p>
    <p>Again, all credit for the recipe goes to Allrecipes.</p>
